# Investigating Income Inequality in United States
## About
This is a SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence mini project which address wage discrimination.

## Practical Motivation and Problem Definition
Income inequality, which is defined as the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population, has been a highly discussed topic in America. This is especially so in relation to rising concerns of Racism, Sexism and Ageism, where certain races, genders and people above a certain age, are said to be unfairly paid less for the same amount of work.

As such, we would like to investigate the state of income inequality and to provide a tool that helps job seekers to determine the fair compensation they should be receiving, in an attempt to alleviate the problem.

## Project Goals
1. Explore the extent of wage discrimination based on age, gender and race in United States.
2. Develop a model that recommends wages based on modifiable factors, such as education, experience, industry and occupation and ignores non-modifiable factors such as age, gender and race. 

## Data Source 
- [Gender Pay Gap](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset) dataset on Kaggle

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Bayesian Ridge Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

## Approach 
1. Data preparation was done to select key features that were relevant for our analysis.
2. Data cleaning was done to remove incorrect values and null values.
3. Exploratory data analysis was done to identify the extent of income inequality across age, gender and race. Insights were derived from analysis results.
4. Futher data pre-processing was done to scale the data and remove outliers.
5. Machine learning models were trained with a 80-20 train-test split. Hyperparameters were tuned to increase model accuracy. 

## Conclusion
- Wage disparity based on Age, Gender and Race does exist in the United States
    - Wages start to decline after 50 years old even as years of experience increases
    - Females earn about 32% less than Males on average and underearn Males at all quartiles
    - White Americans earn about 35% more than Black and Hispanic Americans
- Random Forest Regression was the best model out of the 5 models deployed.
- Machine Learning could be used to provide a fair income benchmark based only on modifiable factors but more work needs to be done
    - More data needs to be collected and in the present to accurately reflect the current situation. Including data across a few decades, which have different socio-economic situations, may have introduced bias into the data and reduced data quality. 
    - More complex models, such as nerual networks could be employed to give more accurate predictions. 


## What did we learn from this project?
- Data cleaning and pre-processing 
- Data visualisation with pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotllib 
- Various regression models with sklearn 
- Collaborating on data science projects with Google Colab
